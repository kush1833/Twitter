# Twitter
A practice project to simulate Twitter backend with limited features

Design a low-level system architecture for a simplified version of Twitter. Your design should focus on the following core functionalities:

    User Management:
        Users should be able to sign up, log in, and log out.
        Store user profiles, which include basic information such as username, password, email, and profile picture.

    Tweet Management:
        Users should be able to post tweets (text content up to 280 characters).
        Each tweet should have a timestamp and be associated with the user who posted it.

    Timeline:
        Users should be able to see a timeline of tweets from the users they follow, sorted by the most recent tweets first.
        Users should be able to follow and unfollow other users.

    Like and Retweet:
        Users should be able to like tweets.
        Users should be able to retweet other users' tweets, which will also appear on their followers' timelines.

Constraints:

    Focus on the core functionalities mentioned above; additional features like comments, hashtags, direct messages, etc., are out of scope for this interview.
    

Deliverables:

    An ER diagram or any other diagram that helps explain the data model.
    A description of the APIs and their endpoints.
    An explanation of the entity schema.
